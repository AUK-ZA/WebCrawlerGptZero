    "They analyzed it to see which demographic bought a particular product or which would be willing to spend more on a better product.": 0.01,
    "Like the internet of things, fusion strategy involves a network of physical objects embedded with sensors, software, and connectivity.": 0.63,
    "But fusion strategy goes beyond equipping an analog product so that you can monitor it and collect data from it over the internet.": 0.07,
    "It requires senior-level executives from different departments to work together to determine how sensor data can be harnessed to deliver value to existing customers and to create new products for future customers.": 0.28,
    "Fusion strategy, in contrast, is cross-functional.": 0.17,
    "Designers build internet-enabled products that generate data that can be used in future iterations of those products.": 0.16,
    "While the machinery behind the internet of things ensures that data is recorded and logged, fusion strategy applies that data immediately, observing products' use across diverse settings and then leveraging information on it to offer automated, personalized recommendations or experiences to customers.": 0.91,
    "Fusion strategy also generates insights and benefits more quickly than the internet of things does.": 0.09,
    "It's about experimenting with newer technologies and developing a road map for incorporating them to get an edge.": 0.02,
    "Experimenting with all four fusion strategies will allow them to determine how they can create and capture value, evaluate how other companies' strategies threaten them, and determine how best to allocate their resources.": 0.5,
    "The strategic opportunities presented by traditional and generative AI and other advanced digital technologies fall into four main categories: fusion products, fusion services, fusion systems, and fusion solutions.": 0.25,
    "Although most companies should start by focusing on fusion products, they should also explore and test the three other strategies.": 0.25,
    "The amount of data they generate is increasingly massive, and companies can apply AI to it in three ways: They can use traditional AI to analyze it for, say, potential product, process, and cost improvements; they can use generative AI to create digital twins of existing products (virtual duplicates that mirror their functioning) and train robots; and they can use the large language models within generative AI to develop proprietary insights that will add value for customers.": 0.48,
    "The system also incorporates insights gathered from Tesla's supply chain, manufacturing operations, and after-sales services.": 0.44,
    "Tesla is now experimenting with using generative AI to program autonomous vehicles.": 0.22,
    "By studying video data taken from inside every Tesla, generative AI can reconstruct multitudes of driving scenarios, which Tesla can then use to train cars to avoid collisions and other dangers.": 0.18,
    "In each Tesla an operating system, which houses data from all the vehicles, helps it respond quickly to insights from hundreds of thousands of cars.": 0.05,
    "The window manufacturer View, for instance, has developed smart glass that uses real-time data and AI to automatically adjust how much sunlight gets in.": 0.23,
    "Tesla's competitors are now trying to catch up by developing their own original fusion products.": 0.08,
    "Mercedes is focusing on designing AI-enhanced operating systems for its vehicles and has teamed up with Nvidia for software, hardware, and AI chips.": 0.06,
    "Another option is to offer performance contracts to guarantee that fusion products will be proactively maintained and updated, ensuring minimal downtime.": 0.45,
    "Product makers can justify higher pricing if their offerings perform better than those of rivals and cost less to operate.": 0.03,
    "For instance, weather and climate data from companies such as Weather.com and ClimateAi allows farmers to make precise decisions in a timely manner and enhance profitability.": 0.12,
    "In their early stages, fusion services can be sold through unbundled pricing, with buyers paying only for services they find valuable.": 0.43,
    "As customers' appreciation for the services grows, industrial companies can migrate to offering bundled packages of services.": 0.06,
    "They can then use those twins to experiment with mixing and matching different permutations of products, machines, components, and peripherals to determine which combination of technologies works best.": 0.18,
    "This is where AI plays a key role.": 0.13,
    "Honeywell collects real-time data from the building's intricate system and analyzes it to identify anomalies, such as malfunctioning equipment.": 0.13,
    "Ultimately, the battle for customers will be between different fusion ecosystems, not individual companies.": 0.4,
    "To create the greatest value for customers, industrial companies will have to partner with other businesses to develop ecosystems of solutions.": 0.18,
    "Granular's models collect and analyze imagery from satellites, gathering information on weather, elevations, and soil conditions, and combine that data with historical yield statistics to help Deere's customers forecast costs, revenues, and profits.": 0.16,
    "While each fusion strategy creates pools of value for businesses, by combining them all, fusion solutions will create the most value.": 0.16
