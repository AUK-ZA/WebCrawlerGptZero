    "How Fusion Strategy Differs from the Internet of Things Traditionally, industrial manufacturers looked mostly at sales and marketing data.": 0.44,
    "Digital systems weren't that important.": 0.22,
    "Data on that must be gathered constantly, and insights from it applied in real time to customers' problems.": 0.18,
    "Today, however, industrial goods companies must also focus on what happens after the saleᅳon how combinations of digital and analog products enable positive outcomes for customers.": 0.13,
    "With fusion strategy, you completely reimagine how that analog product could be designed to function if it were built from scratch using every digital tool and functionality available.": 0.3,
    "The separate functions don't really have to coordinate their efforts.": 0.2,
    "Responsibility for fusion strategy is also handled differently in organizations.": 0.13,
    "The internet of things is owned at the functional level, and use cases are straightforward: Managers in operations (such as supply chain coordinators and quality control executives) use the data from sensors to ensure that machinery-based processes adhere to specific industry standards and protocols.": 0.06,
    "They will invest in the internet of things to adhere to safety standards, but the real differentiation they gain is in how sensors, software, and data connectivity are integrated to make their cars perform better than competitors'.": 0.38,
    "The business case for fusion strategy is competitive differentiation.": 0.31,
    "You can see this happening with the automotive companies that are developing self-driving vehicles.": 0.29,
    "Fusion Products As we've noted, fusion products are designed from scratch to collect and leverage information on products' use in real time.": 0.52,
    "For more than three decades incumbent automakers have added digital features to their products, including GM's OnStar, Ford's Sync, and Mercedes's Mbrace, but those features didn't enable the companies to track automobiles in real time, analyze data continuously, and improve vehicles on the fly the way Tesla does.": 0.47,
    "Take Tesla automobiles.": 0.34,
    "They were designed from the start to be cloud-connected computers on wheels.": 0.19,
    "The system integrates three digital twins: a virtual rendering of the car's model as it was designed (the product twin), a virtual version of the assembly line that created it (the process twin), and a representation of the product in use (the performance twin).": 0.1,
    "(Although last fall it had to withdraw them after their safety came under question, once GM understands the causes of safety lapses, it will probably resume operating the taxis.)": 0.24,
    "When natural light in a room is low, the glass allows more in, but if the room gets too hot, it will filter sunlight out.": 0.16,
    "GM, partnering with its subsidiary Cruise, already has put self-driving taxis on the road.": 0.13,
    "Fusion products can be found in other industries too.": 0.1,
    "Rolls-Royce is one company that does this.": 0.22,
    "When something fails on one of its engines, Rolls-Royce knows about it in advance or finds out in real time, which allows it to troubleshoot the problem much more quickly.": 0.16,
    "The most attractive option is to charge premium prices for themᅳas Tesla does.": 0.1,
    "Early movers can capture value from fusion products in several ways.": 0.02,

    "Tesla, for instance, has gone into the automobile insurance business and can offer rates that are lower than the competition's because of its ability to record and analyze the behavior of individual drivers instead of clustering them into different risk profiles, which is how other insurers operate.": 0.63,
    "Another way to capture value is to use fusion product insights to enter adjacent spaces.": 0.37,
    "Fusion Services Until now services related to industrial goods have been labor-intensive to deliver, with businesses relying on codified knowledge and standard protocols to fix problems.": 0.51,
    "New ventures have already jumped on this opportunity.": 0.22,
    "But today, rather than using an army of on-site technicians to provide services, industrial companies can let customized recommendations generated by AI from product-in-use data flow automatically to customers.": 0.07,
    "Norm, a ChatGPT app for agriculture, mines available data on weather, soil conditions, and current events to answer all kinds of questions about farm management.": 0.06,

    "Fusion Systems Many customers of Deere and of other makers of farm and construction equipment use complex systems that include multiple kinds of machines, each of which is made by a different specialized supplier.": 0.35,
    "Digitization can make operating them a lot easier.": 0.23,
    "But with fusion systems, it shifts from a micro level (enhancing products from different companies independently to improve their efficiency) to a macro level (enhancing multiple related products from multiple companies in concert to improve the whole system's efficiency).": 0.21,
    "And instead of being responsible just for interconnecting different elements and getting the system to work, as traditional systems integrators are, the creator of a fusion system must ensure that it improves continually as new parts and functionality are added.": 0.15,
    "Most customers manage the interoperability of these machines themselves, but some hire systems integrators and consultants to install, connect, and upgrade them.": 0.06,
    "But the advanced firms feed unstructured dataᅳlike images of defects, the sound of faulty machines, and video feeds of autonomous processesᅳinto generative AI in real time to develop complex, realistic digital twins of systems.": 0.43,

    "Deere, for instance, has teamed up with the agricultural software company Granular, which uses unstructured data to develop yield models for farmers.": 0.05,
    "Every industrial company will have to develop its own fusion strategy.": 0.3,
    "Until now industrial companies have competed by developing proprietary technologies and integrating vertically.": 0.27,
    "This will be a major shift, however, and will require industrial CEOs to lead digital effortsᅳa responsibility they've usually delegated in the past.": 0.17,
    "The first step will be to stop treating human intelligence and machine intelligence as if they were separate.": 0.06,
    "The companies that embrace that kind of collaborative intelligence will outperform those that treat AI as an esoteric technology or postpone its adoption.": 0.06
